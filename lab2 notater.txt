task 1

controller is implemented

task2 

implemented matrices A and B in matlab, and computed the K values for a given pole placement
Also added 8 to ~Vs

poles:
pole 1,2,3 = -0.1,-0.2,-0.3; result; somewhat stable, but slow response. Converges after some time

pole 1,2,3 = -1,-2,-3; result; oscillating pitch angle, no convergence

pole 1,2,3 = -0.7 -1.6 -2.1; result; oscillations on pitch angle but converges after some time.

pole 1,2,3 = -0.7 -1.6 -1.9; same as previous test, slightly better

task3


LQR
Q = 3x3 = I result: slow respons but stable and converges
R = 2x2 = I

increace of Q while R = I
this results in a very responsive system, which converges fast. 
We tried Q = 10 to 100 and it resulted in similar results.

increase of R while Q = I
this results in the controller output not responding very well.

R = 0.2 Q = 10

this results in responsive controll, without oscillations. 

R = 0.2 Q = 100

this results in a very responsive system, but with small oscillations

LQR summary
increasing R will limit the output U of the system. Increasing Q will make the system converge faster. 

task 3

Integral action implemented
result with vs without integral action

q = 100, r =1
with integral action the response was faster then without
