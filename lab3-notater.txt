oppgave 1

Task1
	y = pitch 90 grader = 10
	pitch 0 grader = 0
	y akse = blÃ¥

	z = rÃ¸d

	x = gul

	Guroskop vs encoder:

	One angle at a time:
	-pitch is good
	-elevation is good
	-travelrate is good
Task2
	Two angles at a time:
	Test 1: pithch and elevarion: pitch and elevation readings where good, but travelrate was not good
	test 2: pitch and travelrate: pitch is good, travelrate has some deviation, elevationrate is not good.
	test 3: elevation and travelrate: all measurements where ok, but some deviation

	Reason for deviation is that the coordinate system of the IMU moves when we rotate the helicopter, but the 
	coordinatesystem for the encoders is fixed

	comparing angles from encoder with angles from IMU(with calculations)
	the angles are very similar, but the elevation has some deviation. 
	if pitch crosses pi/2 rad, the angle from the IMU will read -pi/2 rad, This is becouse tan is 

	comparing rad/s from IMU with rad/s from eulertransformation block
	without the transformation block, the elevation was not measured "correctly" since the coordinatesystem of the IMU 
	changed as the pitch angle on the helicopter changed, while the helicopters coordinatesystem is static. When the transformation block
	was included the measurement of elevation was corrected.
Task3
	comperason: encoder vs estimated:
	the estimated values has some deviation from the decoder, some of the deviation is due to the fact that the encoder has zero values 
	when initialized but the estimator measures zero as expected. The estimator was a little slower then the response from the encoders.
	
	comperason: estimator vs IMU raw data
	the noise from the raw signal is reduced in the estimated values
	
	poleplacement:
	-10,-8,-4,-7,-8--> estimate is responsive relative to IMU measurement
	-100,-80,-40,-70,-80--> estimate is noisy, but very responsive
	-1,-2,-1,-2.-1--> estimate is very slow, but supresses noise heavely
