task 1; 
Hard to controll. Easyer with lower gain.

task2;
we added 0.55 to the elevation encoder output.
kf was determined to be Kf = 0.713

task 3;
1
pole1 = -1	stable but slow pitch response
pole2 = -0.3 
2
pole1 = -3	unwanted oscillations(underdamped) faster response then (1)
pole2 = -1
3
pole1 = 0	uncontrollable
pole2 = 0
4
pole1 = -0.1	somewhat stable, but not responsive to pitch input
pole2 = -0.5
5
pole1 = -9	pitch oscillated with growing amplitude
pole2 = -5
